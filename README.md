This project is the final project for my supervised learning course from the University of Colorado Boulder. The inspiration behind this project is from the article linked below. The goal is to use supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machins to distinguish the source of PFAS contamination being generated by Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and non AFFF sources. Although I was not able to fully compile the data used by the paper due to time constraints I was still able to replicate their success with a smaller data set.
